# Merry Christmas

This little script brings some festive cheer right into your Windows 11 shell, using ANSI colors to wish you a Merry Christmas in style. It's like a holiday greeting, but with a bit more *colorful* flair.

Created using the default shell colors and good old ANSI Escape Sequences. If you're curious about how it all works, you can check out the [MSDN Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences?redirectedfrom=MSDN) for a deep dive into the world of terminal colors.

A HUGE shoutout to [Michele Locati](https://github.com/mlocati) for the fantastic [win10colors.cmd](https://gist.github.com/mlocati/fdabcaeb8071d5c75a2d51712db24011#file-win10colors-cmd) that made my life infinitely easier.

*P.S. No actual elves were harmed in the making of this script.*
